  "body": "I enjoy understanding machine learning, complex systems, mathematical models and data science methods and concepts, and communicating them with others, especially in a fun or creative way.\r\n\r\nI also enjoy helping others with understanding or writing about scientific or research topics, including writing, editing or proofreading.\r\n\r\n## Machine Learning\r\nMost recently, I'm more interested in Machine Learning methods and how they can be used to understand phenomena.  I recently worked analyzing handwriting (acceleration and orientation of pen while writing) to automatically detect written characters using signal processing and machine learning.  [See my project here.](https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Handwriting-Recognition).\r\n\r\n## Complex Systems and Big Data\r\nI have also published in the area of Complex Systems.  We looked into human mobility patterns, researching the scaling of the length of trips in cities, and comparing our results with conventional survey data to those obtained using Big Data.  Our goal was to determine whether human mobility is \"super-diffusive\" within cities --  that is, do people take more long trips than we might normally expect, especially for fossil-fuel modes?  This could have large implications for energy consumption and urban planning.  [See my project here.](https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Human-Mobility-Research)\r\n\r\nAlso see [Publications](https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Publications) for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Python and Machine Learning Tutorials in your browser\r\n\r\nI've recently converted two third-party tutorials to Jupyter Notebooks, so you can explore them easily in your browser.\r\n\r\nHere is a [version of the Python Tutorial](https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Tutorials/tree/master/Jupyter---Python3-tutorial-notebooks), Jupyter Notebook in Python 3.5.\r\n\r\n... and here is a [Machine Learning / Scikit Learn tutorial](https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Tutorials/tree/master/Scikit_Learn) I've also recently converted to a Jupyter Notebook.\r\n\r\nTo get started:\r\n\r\nGo here and download Anaconda version 3.5: (pre-packaged python for easy installation):\r\n\r\n* [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)  (link on the RIGHT for Python 3)\r\n\r\n* start with:\r\n> jupyter-notebook 3_An_Informal_Introduction_to_Python_(3).ipynb\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n> jupyter-notebook Getting_Started_with_Kaggle.ipynb\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this helps :)   Of course, if you prefer the original tutorials, see the README files for links!\r\n\r\n### About me:  \r\nI am an experienced researcher in Complex Systems and Machine Learning, both in academia and private industry.  I have also worked in a variety of areas of Computer Science, Geography, and Mathematics research.  Contact me for more details.\r\n\r\n",
