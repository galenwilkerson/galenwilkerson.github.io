Feel free to contact me about that too!\r\n\r\n### About me:  \r\nI am an experienced researcher in Complex Systems and Machine Learning.\r\n\r\nMost recently, I'm more interested in Machine Learning methods and how they can be used to understand data.\r\nHowever, I have also published in the Human Mobility domain, researching the scaling of trip lengths in cities and comparing results using conventional data to those obtained using Big Data.\r\n\r\nSee Publications for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Python Tutorial in your browser\r\n\r\nHere is a link to my [my repository](https://github.com/galenwilkerson), \r\nincluding a [version of the Python Tutorial](https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Tutorials/tree/master/Jupyter---Python3-tutorial-notebooks),\r\nconverted to run Python 3 in a Jupyter Notebook, in your browser!\r\n\r\nGo here and download Anaconda version 3.5: (pre-packaged python for easy installation):\r\n\r\n* [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)  (link on the RIGHT for Python 3)\r\n\r\n* start with\r\n> jupyter-notebook 3_An_Informal_Introduction_to_Python_(3).ipynb\r\n\r\nI hope this helps :)\r\n",
