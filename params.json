  "body": "I enjoy understanding Machine Learning, Complex Systems, and Data Science methods and concepts, and communicating them with others, especially in a fun or creative way.\r\n\r\nI also enjoy helping others with understanding or writing about scientific or research topics, including editing or proofreading.\r\n\r\n### About me:  \r\nI am an experienced researcher in Complex Systems and Machine Learning, both in academia and private industry.\r\n\r\n## Machine Learning\r\nMost recently, I'm more interested in Machine Learning methods and how they can be used to understand data.  I recently worked analyzing Handwriting data (acceleration and orientation of pen while writing) to automatically detect written characters using signal processing and machine learning.  [See my project here.](https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Handwriting-Recognition).\r\n\r\n## Complex Systems and Big Data\r\nHowever, I have also published in the area of Complex Systems of Human Mobility, researching the scaling of human trip-lengths in cities, and comparing our results using conventional data to those obtained using Big Data.  Our goals was to determine whether human mobility is \"super-diffusive\" within cities.  That is, do people take more long trips than we might normally expect?  This could have large implications for energy consumption and urban planning.  [See my project here.](https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Human-Mobility-Research)\r\n\r\nAlso see [Publications](https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Publications) for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Python Tutorial in your browser\r\n\r\nHere is a link to my [my repository](https://github.com/galenwilkerson), \r\nincluding a [version of the Python Tutorial](https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Tutorials/tree/master/Jupyter---Python3-tutorial-notebooks),\r\nconverted to run Python 3 in a Jupyter Notebook, in your browser!\r\n\r\nGo here and download Anaconda version 3.5: (pre-packaged python for easy installation):\r\n\r\n* [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)  (link on the RIGHT for Python 3)\r\n\r\n* start with\r\n> jupyter-notebook 3_An_Informal_Introduction_to_Python_(3).ipynb\r\n\r\nI hope this helps :)\r\n",
