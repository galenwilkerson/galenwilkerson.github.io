        <p>I enjoy understanding Machine Learning, Complex Systems, and Data Science methods and concepts, and communicating them with others, especially in a fun or creative way.</p>

<p>I also enjoy helping others with understanding or writing about scientific or research topics, including editing or proofreading.</p>

<p>Most recently, I'm more interested in Machine Learning methods and how they can be used to understand data.  I recently worked analyzing Handwriting data (acceleration and orientation of pen while writing) to automatically detect written characters using signal processing and machine learning.  <a href="https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Handwriting-Recognition">See my project here.</a>.</p>

<p>However, I have also published in the area of Complex Systems of Human Mobility, researching the scaling of human trip-lengths in cities, and comparing our results using conventional data to those obtained using Big Data.  Our goals was to determine whether human mobility is "super-diffusive" within cities.  That is, do people take more long trips than we might normally expect?  This could have large implications for energy consumption and urban planning.  <a href="https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Human-Mobility-Research">See my project here.</a></p>

<p>I've recently converted two third-party tutorials to Jupyter Notebooks, so you can explore them easily in your browser.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Tutorials/tree/master/Jupyter---Python3-tutorial-notebooks">version of the Python Tutorial</a>, Jupyter Notebook in Python 3.5.</p>

<p>... and here is a <a href="https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Tutorials/tree/master/Scikit_Learn">Machine Learning / Scikit Learn tutorial</a> I've also recently converted to a Jupyter Notebook.</p>

<p>To get started:</p>

<p>Go here and download Anaconda version 3.5: (pre-packaged python for easy installation):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">https://www.continuum.io/downloads</a>  (link on the RIGHT for Python 3)</p></li>
<li>
<p>start with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>jupyter-notebook 3_An_Informal_Introduction_to_Python_(3).ipynb</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
<p>jupyter-notebook Getting_Started_with_Kaggle.ipynb</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope this helps :)</p>
