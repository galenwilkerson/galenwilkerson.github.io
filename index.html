      <section>
        <p>I enjoy understanding Machine Learning, Complex Systems, and Data Science methods and concepts, and communicating them with others, especially in a fun or creative way.</p>

<p>I also realize that many people from other countries are entering this field, and hope to improve their English along with technical skills.   Feel free to contact me for assistance!</p>

<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me:</h3>

<p>I am an experienced researcher in Complex Systems and Machine Learning, both in academia and private industry.</p>

<p>Most recently, I'm more interested in Machine Learning methods and how they can be used to understand data.  I recently worked analyzing Handwriting data (acceleration and orientation of pen while writing) to automatically detect written characters using signal processing and machine learning.  <a href="https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Handwriting-Recognition">See my project here.</a>.</p>

<p>However, I have also published in the Human Mobility domain, researching the scaling of trip lengths in cities and comparing results using conventional data to those obtained using Big Data, to try to determine if human mobility is "super-diffusive" within cities, which could have large implications for energy consumption and urban planning.  <a href="https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Human-Mobility-Research">See my project here.</a></p>

<p>Also see <a href="https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Publications">Publications</a> for more information.</p>

<a id="python-tutorial-in-your-browser" class="anchor" href="#python-tutorial-in-your-browser" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Python Tutorial in your browser</h3>

<p>Here is a link to my <a href="https://github.com/galenwilkerson">my repository</a>, 
including a <a href="https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Tutorials/tree/master/Jupyter---Python3-tutorial-notebooks">version of the Python Tutorial</a>,
converted to run Python 3 in a Jupyter Notebook, in your browser!</p>

<p>Go here and download Anaconda version 3.5: (pre-packaged python for easy installation):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">https://www.continuum.io/downloads</a>  (link on the RIGHT for Python 3)</p></li>
<li>
<p>start with</p>

<blockquote>
<p>jupyter-notebook 3_An_Informal_Introduction_to_Python_(3).ipynb</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this helps :)</p>
